### Hi there üëã

For the past years, I have worked on the following repositories "CareerTrack" and "CareerTrack-FrontEnd", trying to follow the clean-code best practices. It currently represents my work samples that I consider most representative to illustrate my technical profile.<br />
<br />
You may have a look at this [video](https://youtu.be/r3cjCAtZkuk).
The repositories bellow are private, but I would be happy to present you the code on a live discussion.
<br />
‚óæ CareerTrack: .NET Web api<br />
‚óæ CareerTrack-FrontEnd: front-end written using React and Redux<br />
‚óæ CareerTrack-ApiPublisher: additional project for automatic back-end deployment. [Demo](https://youtu.be/plXVYkUZ5pI)
<br />
You can also check some of my previous work<br />
‚óæ [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/serializingjson.htm) vs [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) : here I am comparing the times of serializing and deserializing using these libraries<br />

### Hi there 👋

For the past years, I have worked on the following repositories "CareerTrack" and "CareerTrack-FrontEnd", trying to follow the clean-code best practices. It currently represents my work samples that I consider most representative to illustrate my technical profile.<br />
<br />
The repositories are pinned bellow
<br />
◾ CareerTrack: .NET Web api<br />
◾ CareerTrack-FrontEnd: front-end written using React and Redux<br />
<br />
You can also check some of my previous work<br />
◾ [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/serializingjson.htm) vs [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) : here I am comparing the times of serializing and deserializing using this libraries<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪️ link to the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNi18e0p7zQ).<br />
◾ Medium article about [various ways of implementing Background tasks](https://medium.com/@sosuliviu/lets-talk-about-scheduled-background-tasks-2708b9873941).

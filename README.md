### Hi there 👋

For the past years I have worked on the follwing repositories "CareerTrack" and "CareerTrack-FrontEnd", trying to follow the clean-code best practices.<br />
<br />
The repositories are pinned bellow
<br />
◾ CareerTrack: .NET Web api<br />
◾ CareerTrack-FrontEnd: front-end written using React and Redux<br />
You can also check some of my previous work
◾ [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/serializingjson.htm) vs [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) : here I am comapring the times of serliazing and deselizing using this libraries<br />
